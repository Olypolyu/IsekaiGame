# IsekaiGame
The base idea about the game is to make a story driven RPG based around death. This is a game where you play a character that recently got hit by a truck (or whatever) then found himself in a generic fantasy world.

## story
As the player you can talk to NPCs with multiple choice dialog to get a determinated ending. They will send you to quests or interact with you in different ways, however which, it will end with you dying and sometimes getting a item that can be used to unlock more endings. This is very inspired by kindergarten 1&2.


## gameplay
Together with this, the game will feature 2d zelda styled dungeons and turn based combat based on *time*. That being, your moves cost only the time(in turns) that it takes to cast them.

IE:
You cast fireball, it takes 3 turns.

In turn, your enemy casts scratch that takes only 2 turns. 

This gives you a choice to make. One where you have a single turn available to act with a quick action, however do to so it will cost your current 3 turn action that's mid casting.

One might choose to evade the attack or parry it by forfeiting the 3 turn fireball, likewise, one might tank the damage in a controlled manner to fire the fireball anyways.

### ideas:
- I think it'd be a cool idea to have so your moves appear in a card deck that's randomly selected from like a TCG.
